All of the following assumes we are working at the top UAM directory.

Let's say we would like to grade the assignment A1.

1) We need a directory named "submissions" in the uam directory, with the following structure:
submissions/group_name/A1/...files...

TIPS:
- I usually create a symlink to wherever I want to have all my submissions, e.g. run:
  ln -s pam/examples/submissions/ submissions
- You can get a script to check out all submissions from MarkUs.

2) We need the following lists:

2a) A classlist in the csv format:
UTORID,first,last,student-number,email
(let's call this list students.csv, for the purposes of our example)

TIPS:
- You can get this list from Blackboard.

2b) A list of directory paths to individual submissions.
(let's call this list directories.txt, for the purposes of our example)

2c) A list of directory paths, together with repo names.
(let's call this list dirs_and_names.txt, for the purposes of our example)

2d) A list of student groups in the format:
group_name,group_repo,user_name1,user_name2,...
(let's call this list groups.txt, for the purposes of our example)

TIPS:
- You can get this list from MarkUs.

3) Copy the file pam/examples/config.py to the top level directory and edit it.

4) Run:
python3 test_runner.py

5) Aggregate results:
python3 aggregator.py A1 pam/examples/dirs_and_names.txt pam/examples/students.csv pam/examples/groups.txt result.json aggregated.json

6) Format results with one of:
python3 templator.py aggregated.json txt
python3 templator.py aggregated.json html
python3 templator.py aggregated.json gf
python3 templator.py aggregated.json markus
