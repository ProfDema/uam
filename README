Let's say we would like to grade A1.

1) We need a directory named "submissions" in the uam directory,
with the following structure:

submissions/group_name/A1/...files...

I usually create a symlink to wherever I want to have all my 
submissions.

One way to check out submissions from svn is to use a script
.../uam/utils/checkoutRepos.sh

This script needs an svn_repo_list file which you can get from
MarkUs.

2) We need the following lists:

i) A classlist in the csv format:

UTORID,first,last,student-number,email

You can get this list from Blackboard.

(Lets call this list classlist.csv, for the purposes of our example.)

ii) A list of directory paths to individual submissions. 

One way to create this list is by running the script
.../uam/utils/listDirs.sh

(Lets call this list A1_directories.txt, for the purposes of our example.)

iii) A list of directory paths, together with repo names.

One way to create this list is by running the script
.../uam/utils/listDirsAndNames.sh

(Lets call this list A1_dirs_and_names.txt, for the purposes of our example.)

iv) A list of student groups in the format:

group_name,group_repo,user_name1,user_name2,...

You can get this list from MarkUs.

(Lets call this list A1_groups.txt, for the purposes of our example.)

3) Edit the file config.py.

4) Run 
 python3 test_runner.py

5) Run 
 python3 aggregator.py A1 A1_dirs_and_names.txt classlist.csv A1_groups.txt result.json A1_aggregated.json

6) Run 
 python3 templator.py A1_aggregated.json txt

 python3 templator.py A1_aggregated.json gf

 python3 templator.py A1_aggregated.json markus

7) Email anya@cs.utoronto.ca if confused.
