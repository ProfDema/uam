UAM stands for Unified AutoMarker and it's a framework to test student assignments in a variety of programming
languages, collect the results and export them using templates. It currently supports Python (PAM) and Java (JAM).

The top level directory contains the framework scripts to be launched, the pam directory contains the Python AutoMarker
with instructions and examples, the jam directory contains the Java AutoMarker with instructions and examples.

REQUIREMENTS:

You need Python 3 installed in your system. Then, install the requirements listed in the file requirements.txt using pip
(pip install -r /path_to_uam/requirements.txt). You can use virtualenv to avoid installing the packages system-wide
(https://virtualenv.pypa.io).

For JAM, you also need Java installed in your system.
